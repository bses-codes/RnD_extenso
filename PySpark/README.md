# PySpark Data Processing Repository

This repository contains PySpark scripts that are used to replicate the functionality of SQL scripts from SQL Assignments branch as well as various PySpark practice exercises.
## Overview of Scripts

1. **Balance_Calc.ipynb** - A PySpark script replicating the functionality of the `Balance.sql` SQL script.
2. **Average.ipynb** - Converts the SQL tasks in `assign1.sql` into PySpark operations.
3. **Untitled** - Contains PySpark notebook and scripts used for practice and learning the fundamental concepts of PySpark.

## Script Details

### 1. Balance_Calc.ipynb

This script uses PySpark to perform the same operations as the `Balance.sql` script. It involves reading data, transforming it, and calculating running balances.

#### Features:
- Read data from source formats supported by PySpark.
- Clean and format data fields.
- Calculate running balances using PySpark's DataFrame API.

### 2. Average.ipynb

This script replicates the database and table creation, data loading, and data aggregation tasks defined in the assign1.sql

#### Features:
- Creation of Spark DataFrames to mimic SQL tables.
- Data aggregation and transformation using DataFrame transformations.

### 3. Untitled.ipynb

This notebook containsvarious practice scripts to help learn and master PySpark.
