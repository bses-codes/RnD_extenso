# Regression Analysis Repository

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of linear and logistic regression models using the `scikit-learn` library.

## Overview of Scripts

The repository includes scripts that perform the following:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**

## Features

### Linear Regression

- **Data Generation**: Generates linear data with some added noise.
- **Model Fitting**: Fits a linear regression model to the data.
- **Visualization**: Plots the original data and the fitted line to visualize the model's performance.

### Logistic Regression

- **Data Generation**: Generates binary classification data using a normal distribution.
- **Model Fitting**: Fits a logistic regression model to the data.
- **Probability Estimation**: Computes and visualizes the probability estimates across the data range.

## Dependencies

To run the scripts, you will need:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
